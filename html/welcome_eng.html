    <h2>Guideline and Web Client for WFS </h2>
    <p>A "Norway digital" project which prepares a technical WFS guideline with examples and promotes the use of WFS through a reusable Web Client:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create guidelines on how to get started with WFS for Norway digital partners.</li>
      <li>Addressing the demands for use of the WFS.</li>
      <li>Try to limit the different implementation methods.</li>
      <li>Show practical examples of configuration and queries.</li>
      <li>Give examples using both WMS and WFS from the same service.</li>
      <li>The WFS group represents a broad technical background, both from the private and public sectors.</li>
      <li>Agreement within the group is important to ensure academic breadth and ease of use in practice.</li>
      <li>The guideline must also be coordinated with similar projects like Geosyncronizing and GML.</li>
      <li>The WFS Client is intended as a supplement to the guide.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>The application has a simple MVC-based code that is reusable for other contexts. Running the predefined queries, editing and uploading including validation of custom queries. Reuse of explanations and figures from the guideline in separate description tabs.</p>
